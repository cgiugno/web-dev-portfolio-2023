                  As for my findings? <br>The task of setting up data fetching from a Large Language Model is not

                <p class="vg-video-demos-text-p-2">
                  However, for large projects, such as video games, because that cost is multiplied by every user who
                  fetches dialogue through the app, because the response is unpredictable, and because a writer remains
                  necessary to create the prompts, that the option is not sustainable. <br>For now, at least, LLMs
                  cannot

              <p class="p-video-demos-text-p-1">
                Though I’m satisfied with the visuals—this still was one of my first projects. So, what would I
                do better next time?
              </p>
              <p class="p-video-demos-text-p-2">
                1. <b>Mobile Responsiveness:</b> The portfolio <i>technically</i> is mobile responsive, but the landing
                page and game development pages especially don’t measure up to my personal standards. In a redesign, I
                would focus on this, since I know that most use mobile devices to visit a portfolio.
              </p>
              <p class="p-video-demos-text-p-3">
                2. <b>Image and Text Modals:</b> As of now, clicking on my work takes a visitor to a tab that displays
                the PDF/PNG file. It’s functional but a less disruptive technique would be to use a modal to allow a
                visitor to examine the work without leaving the portfolio page—another thing for that redesign.
              </p>
              <p class="p-video-demos-text-p-4">
                3. <b>More Excitement!</b> As much as I do like the <br>tranquil color palette, any redesign of the
                <br>portfolio should communicate the passion that went into it. That would mean using brighter colors,
                and energetic, even bouncy CSS animations. I'd also develop a interactive layout that brings visitors
                into the creative process with me: a crowded desk, for example, with an art tablet and journals that
                link to the relevant portfolio pages.

                SAPIEN is a tech start-up company, based on designing virtual avatars for conversations and skills
                training.
                The company needed a sharp, professional front-end within a week to match the back-end they were in the
                process of creating.

                  The site’s front-end was developed in a clean gray and white, to make elements pop, while the rounded
                  corners on elements prevented it from feeling too intimidating. Filtering elements were also
                  incorporated in the avatar gallery and for the feedback page responses.
